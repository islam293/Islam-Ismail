# Google Search Automation
## Introduction
This project is to automate the search process for **Google** search engine. It allows to test more than one test case in the same run by putting all the test cases you want in an excel file and run them one after one by only running the project.
The project is based on selenium tools for automation with Java as a language.
> This project is based on **Page-Oriented Module** & **Data-Driven Module**. You can easily add more actions or steps by adding another page class. Also data is easily changed in the excel file without changing the code.

2. Any Java IDE ( i.e. IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc... )

## Configuration
1. Download the project, unzip it to the desired location.
2. Open your Java IDE and import the project as a maven project.
3. Build all dependencies and wait until all libraries are installed
4. Open data folder then the searchTestcases file and write the test case you want to run.
